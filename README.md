# food_inventory

Food inventory is a tutorial-like project to try out some design patterns. 

It consists of a product factory (design pattern 1) inside an inventory (Singleton pattern). 

## Features
- Create a Singleton class named Inventory so there is only one instance of it.
- Create products such as apples with ID, name, price and quantity as arguments.
- Add products to inventory.
- There are a few methods to test getters, setters, smart pointers to add, remove items or amounts of them (using polymorphism). 
- There is a pseudo-observer pattern which notifies via the console that the amount of a product has reached a threshold. 

## Running the program (tbf)
VSCode was used, building with CMake on Windows.
